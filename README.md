# Plasmid-encoded insertion sequences promote rapid adaptation in clinical enterobacteria

This repository contains all the code used in the work **Plasmid-encoded insertion sequences promote rapid adaptation in clinical enterobacteria**. The code developed for each of the analysis is organized in order for the sections in the results part of the main text of the paper, following the order in which the data was analyzed. For more detail regarding questions different to the code for analyzing and/or plotting consider consulting the Supplementary Material/Methods section of the article.

## Phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses

### Phylogenetic tree

For the analysis of the phylogeny of the strains included in our work we used mashtree as shown in *link_to_script* using the closed reference genomes of each strain *link_OR_reference_to_sequences*. We represented the phylogenetic tree as shown in Figure 1A using the online tool of iTOL at https://itol.embl.de/. 

### pOXA-48 fitness effects

To study the fitness effects of pOXA-48 in the bacterial hosts chosen for the experimental evolution assay, we measured the OD of 6 replicates with and without pOXA-48 for each strain during 24 hours (*link_to_table_of_data*) and calculated the growth of pOXA-48-carrying samples relative to pOXA-48-free ones. The code for the analysis, statistics and plotting of this data (Figure 1B) can be found at *link_to_script*.

### Bacterial growth during experimental evolution

To assess the phenotipic changes during the experimental evolution assay, we measured the bacterial growth of each replicate population each 2 days of the experiment. The raw data for this analysis can be found at *link_to_table_of_data* and the script for the plotting (Figure 1D) and statistical analyses can be checked at *link_to_script*.
