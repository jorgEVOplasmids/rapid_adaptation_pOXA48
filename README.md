# Plasmid-encoded insertion sequences promote rapid adaptation in clinical enterobacteria

This repository contains all the code used in the work **Plasmid-encoded insertion sequences promote rapid adaptation in clinical enterobacteria**. The code developed for each of the analysis is organized in order for the sections in the results part of the main text of the paper, following the order in which the data was analyzed. For more detail regarding questions different to the code for analyzing and/or plotting consider consulting the Supplementary Material/Methods section of the article.

## Phenotypic and phylogenetic analysis

### Phylogenetic tree

For the analysis of the phylogeny of the strains included in our work we used mashtree as shown in *link_to_script* using the closed reference genomes of each strain *link_OR_reference_to_sequences*. We represented the phylogenetic tree as shown in Figure 1A using the online tool of iTOL at https://itol.embl.de/.
